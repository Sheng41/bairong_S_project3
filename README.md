# This is our project3 , my name is ouyang, and I am the website developer, sheng is the designer. about our website, we decided the main color is blue , and also use some green. It's because blue and green  represent ecology and environmental protection, this organization is an organization that protects fish. Also The image on this page is more than the text, so I have a little bit of a font on the page that is easy to read. And each page has some duplicate elements, like, topBar and FUNDRAISING. Putting these elements together and beautifying it will make the work a lot easier for me.
